# rust-icmp

Rust ICMP socket. It is intended to provide similar functionality
as a rust' `std::net::TcpStream` / `std::net::UdpSocket` structs.

## Compatibility

Right now it is an early alpha and supports only latest Linux platform.

I will highly appreciate any pull requests and issues (emails are great too!)
